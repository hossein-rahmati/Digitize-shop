Digitize Shopping

Digitize shopping is a static webpage developed to look around and buy digital devices.

I used the Tailwind.css framework due to its high-speed CSS classes and mobile-first approach and I also used Alpine.js for toggles and dropdowns

The biggest challenge was about untidy HTML & CSS tags and I hope to refactor the website with the React.JS library in future
