Digitize Shopping

Digitize shopping is an static webpage and is developed in order to look around and buy digital devices.

I used Tailwind.css framework due to its high-speed CSS classes and mobile-first approach

The most challenge was about untidy HTML & CSS tags and I hope to refactor website with React.JS library in future
